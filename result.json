    "description": "Best antibiotics for diseases, in this course we will learn about the most effective antibiotics used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. You’ll explore the classification of antibiotics, their mechanisms of action, and how to select the appropriate antibiotic based on the type of infection—such as respiratory, urinary, skin, gastrointestinal, and sexually transmitted diseases. We will also cover antibiotic spectrum => Array(broad vs. narrow), routes of administration, and dosing strategies. The course highlights common antibiotics like penicillins, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and others, with real-world case applications. Special attention will be given to resistance prevention, side effects, and safe usage across different age groups and conditions. By the end of the course, you’ll have a solid understanding of how antibiotics function and how to choose the right one for each disease. This course is ideal for students, healthcare workers, and anyone interested in medical science. Shomu s Biology",
