It has so many goodies and can be served as a first course or a main meal. There\u2019s no real set recipe as it was usually made to use up available vegetables in poorer times. It can be made as a vegetarian meal with vegetable stock or by using meat stock, this recipe uses chicken stock. You can also add pancetta for a different style flavour. Cook the hardy vegetables first and add the rest last, this will retain some bite. Add the basil leaves at the very end to get the full fresh aromas. Buy yourself the best rustic bread loaf, toast it and lace it with olive oil for a fantastic meal Italiano style.SEND FAN MAIL & PRODUCTS TO REVIEW - TO: PO BOX 416MOUNT MARTHA 3934VICTORIA AUSTRALIAhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/recipe30\/https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/recipe30\/Business inquiries: [email&#160;protected]","lesson_author":1,"video":{"source_type":"youtube","source":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3m6Z685HYC8","runtime":{"hours":0,"minutes":2,"seconds":53}}}

There's no need for chicken stock or even vegetable stock, just plain water and it will still leave your taste buds asking for more. It's simple to make with basic ingredients. By adding toasted bread, pinenuts and goat cheese, it will definitely take it to a new level, but it's not necessary, it still tastes great on its own if you don't wish to go that extra step. That's the beauty about this recipe, the broccoli is only cooked for five minutes keeping it green and flavourful and it actually tastes of broccoli. A good broccoli soup should be green and not brown.SEND FAN MAIL & PRODUCTS TO REVIEW - TO: PO BOX 416MOUNT MARTHA 3934VICTORIA AUSTRALIAhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/recipe30\/https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/recipe30\/Business inquiries: [email&#160;protected]","lesson_author":1,"video":{"source_type":"youtube","source":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k6GCQxVIz58","runtime":{"hours":0,"minutes":2,"seconds":37}}}

It's made with chicken stock, carrots, celery, onion pasta and tasty cheesy meatballs. When it rains, and your house is nice and cosy, this is the soup to make. Why a wedding soup? It's nothing to do with weddings, but it is a beautiful marriage of meat and vegetables. When making this soup, please use homemade chicken stock. You don't have to go all out; it can be as simple as throwing a chicken carcass in a pot of water and simmering it for 90 minutes. You will never achieve the same depth of flavour with bought stocks or cubes. I would highly recommend doubling the quantity and freezing half. This is the sort of soup you will crave many times once you've tasted it. Knowing there's this soup waiting for you when you come back from a trip late in the day will make your day! I added provolone cheese for little bursts of flavour; it is optional but recommended. Otherwise, just grate a little more pecorino. You could also use Parmesan cheese. Use the small pasta you like, anything from Ditalini, cavatelli, fusilli, orzo, pastina etc. If you're going to eat all the soup the same day, you can cook it directly in the pot. Otherwise, cook them separate so they remain nice and al dente. For the greens, it's best to use escarole or curly endives. They are loaded with vitamins making this soup healthy. The flavour works magically for soups. Enjoy this Italian wedding soup on a nice cold rainy day for ultimate comfort food.

Harira is a Moroccan soup typically made with lamb or chicken, tomatoes, chickpeas, lentils, and a variety of spices. This version is made using chicken breast. It\u2019s a soup that\u2019s often served during Ramadan as a way to break the fast. The soup is hearty and filling and can be garnished with lemon, cilantro, or mint. I also like to add a dollop of yogurt in the serving bowl, it gives it that creamy tangy flavour that goes so well. Harira is a dish passed down through generations, and each family has their unique recipe. Moroccan families often make it for special occasions, such as weddings and births. Whether you're breaking your fast during Ramadan or simply looking for a delicious and nourishing soup, harira is worth trying! If you are looking for a delicious and nourishing soup, look no further than harira!

[2025-03-15 19:25:53] Lesson data: {"topic_id":24741,"lesson_title":"6 Unforgettable Soup Recipes to Warm Your Soul","lesson_content":"Cream of Mushroom Soup (All the recipe links are below)The best cream of mushroom soup recipe you will find. Perfect for those cold wintery days by the fire. Serve it with a grilled piece of toast coated with butter, olive oil or even grilled cheese. Made with button mushrooms and dried shiitake or porcini for that intense taste. Use a high speed blender to get the creamy consistency you love, and all without cream.Vegetarian French Onion SoupThere\u2019s no more satisfying dish than a French Onion Soup in the colder months. This one is the vegetarian version, and it\u2019s so tasty you\u2019ll never know the difference. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s packed with flavour and made with few ingredients. The cheese croutons can be made with any stale bread. The caramelized onion flavour is what makes this dish so popular. No need for chicken or beef stocks. And if you don\u2019t like wine, then use apple cider. French onion soup is popular around the world with good reason. Traditionally made from a meat stock, caramelised onions, and loads of melted Gruy\u00e8re cheese on croutons.Garlic Soup Italian styleI know what you\u2019re thinking, two heads of garlic, are you crazy! You can relax as the slow cooking of the garlic will dissipate the pungent flavor and leave a pleasing smooth note. This soup really has to be served with croutons or a slice of bruschetta, plus some coarsely chopped parsley for that freshness. A simple soup with amazing flavor and fantastic if you have a cold!Hearty Minestrone SoupMinestrone soup which means \u201cBig Soup\u201d has always been a favourite of mine. It has so many goodies and can be served as a first course or a main meal as it\u2019s quite thick. There\u2019s no real set recipe for minestrone as it was usually made up using available vegetables in poorer times. I personally prefer it simpler as it has a fresher taste. It can be made as a vegetarian meal with vegetable stock or by using meat stock, this recipe uses chicken stock. You can also add pancetta for a different style flavour. Cook the hardy vegetables first and add the rest last, this will retain some bite. Add the basil leaves at the very end to get the full fresh aromas. Buy yourself the best rustic bread loaf, toast it and lace it with olive oil for a fantastic minestrone meal Italiano style. What an awesome comfort food!Roasted Tomato and Basil soupIf you\u2019re a tomato lover like I am, then you will love this soup. The tomatoes are firstly roasted to intensify their flavours and bring out the sugars. The selection of good quality tomatoes is of course important, you want sweetness and flavour. These days a lot of supermarket tomatoes taste like water chestnuts. So the best time to make this soup is when tomatoes are at their peak of the season. That\u2019s also when fresh basil is in season, which is the other important ingredient. Master those two ingredients and you will have a soup to die for. There\u2019s two options here, make it as a regular soup or take it to another level by adding some golden crunch puff pastry. The steam will rise pushing the dough into a dome shape making your soup look like a spectacular souffle from a fancy restaurant. Plus once you crack it open, a puff of fresh basil scented steam will permeate into your senses. It\u2019s theatrical but it\u2019s also a tasty combination. Moroccan Chicken Soup HariraIf you\u2019re a fan of the above hearty minestrone, then you will also love this! Harira is a Moroccan soup typically made with lamb or chicken, tomatoes, chickpeas, lentils, and a variety of spices. This version is made using chicken breast. It\u2019s a soup that\u2019s often served during Ramadan as a way to break the fast.Cream of Mushroom Soup: https:\/\/recipe30.com\/cream-of-mushroom-soup.html\/Vegetarian French Onion Soup: https:\/\/recipe30.com\/vegetarian-french-onion-soup.html\/Garlic Soup Italian style: https:\/\/recipe30.com\/garlic-soup-italian-style.html\/Hearty Minestrone Soup: https:\/\/recipe30.com\/hearty-minestrone-soup.html\/Roasted Tomato and Basil soup: https:\/\/recipe30.com\/roasted-tomato-and-basil-soup.html\/Moroccan Chicken Soup Harira: https:\/\/recipe30.com\/moroccan-chicken-soup-harira.html\/\u25b6 Check out my favourite kitchen tools here (affiliate): https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/recipe30 \u25b6 Follow me on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/recipe30\/\u25b6 Follow me on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/recipe30\/\u25b6Music by Epidemic Sound: https:\/\/www.epidemicsound.com\/referral\/39ip8kWant to mail me something?

[2025-03-15 19:25:54] Lesson data: {"topic_id":24741,"lesson_title":"Tuscan Style Hearty Vegetable Soup for a Rainy Day","lesson_content":"Today, we're diving into a heartwarming Tuscan-style recipe that's perfect for those cozy, cold, and wet days when you need something to warm your soul. We start by chopping up onions, leeks, carrots, celery, and zucchini, along with roughly cut kale leaves. In a heavy-bottomed pot, we sweat these veggies with oregano and garlic, infusing the kitchen with tantalising aromas.Now, here's the twist: the Tuscan connection with my flair. This recipe takes its inspiration from the rustic kitchens of Tuscany, where hearty soups like this are a staple. Tuscans have been masters of turning humble ingredients into culinary masterpieces for centuries, and this dish is no exception. The use of beans, tomatoes, and fresh herbs harks back to the region's rich culinary heritage.As our soup simmers away, we blend one can of beans into a velvety puree to add a little creaminess, while the other stays whole, adding texture. Seasoned with care, we let it simmer for a good 60 minutes, infusing all those flavours. Then, we add the diced zucchini and kale, letting them meld into the mix. Finally, a touch of shredded basil, and you're ready to serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.It's a delightful taste of Tuscany right in your own kitchen, perfect for those chilly days when you need some warmth and comfort in a bowl.
